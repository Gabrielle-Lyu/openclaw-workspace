With front-wheel drive, the new Toyota Camry has 225 horsepower created by a hybrid drivetrain. That’s a jump in output from the previous 208 horsepower, slightly better than the Honda Accord Hybrid’s 204 horses, and noticeably more than the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid’s 192 horsepower. Add all-wheel drive and output climbs to 232 horsepower.

This latest hybrid system has been tuned to be more responsive than before. While driving the new Camry, we found that the electric motor provides a perfect thrust when accelerating from lower speeds. We don’t even miss the optional 301-horsepower V6 of the outgoing generation.

The new Camry’s suspension is also an improvement, bringing a little poise and agility to an otherwise comfort-focused setup. We reckon Camry owners past and present will be pleasantly surprised by this extra nimbleness, especially if they choose all-wheel drive for optimum grip. The SE and XSE models have a sportier suspension tune, yet we’d say they’re still comfortable enough for most tastes.

In general, body roll is kept to a minimum and we enjoyed taking the Camry a little quicker than usual through the turns. As always, the Camry feels easy to drive. The beltline is low, contributing to excellent outward vision, which adds to the confident feeling in the car.

### Fuel Economy

In the popular SE, we’re looking at 47 mpg in combined city/highway driving — that’s with front-wheel drive. Knock off one mile per gallon with all-wheel drive. The front-drive LE is the most frugal with fuel, however, achieving 51 mpg combined.

For reference, the Accord hybrid (front-drive only) manages 48 mpg combined, while the lower-powered Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is rated at 52 mpg combined. All three rivals are acceptable; no one is going to find much to complain about in terms of fuel efficiency.
