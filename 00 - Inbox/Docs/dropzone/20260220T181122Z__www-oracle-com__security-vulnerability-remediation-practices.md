## Critical Patch Update and Security Alert programs

The Critical Patch Update (CPU) is the primary mechanism for the backport of security bug fixes for all Oracle on-premises products. Critical Patch Updates are available to customers with valid support contracts. Critical Patch Updates are released quarterly. Critical Patch Updates are released on the third Tuesday of January, April, July, and October. In addition, Oracle retains the ability to issue out of schedule patches or workaround instructions in case of particularly critical vulnerabilities and/or when active exploits are reported in the wild. This program is known as the Security Alert program. Information about all previously released Security Alerts and Critical Patch Updates, along with the links to download security patches, is posted on the Security Alerts and Critical Patch Updates page.

## Applicability of Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts to Oracle Cloud Environments
