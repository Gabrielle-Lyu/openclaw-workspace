## ⚠️ Moved to Processing (3 files)

### Reason: Minimal/Incomplete Content

**Toyota Camry 2025 Research Files:**
1. `20260221T073214Z__www-kbb-com__2025-toyota-camry-le.md`
   - Only contains login prompt text ("Personalize your 5-Year Cost to Own data by logging in")
   - No substantive content

2. `20260221T073222Z__www-toyota-com__2025-toyota-camry-toyota-com.md`
   - Generic marketing copy about electrified powertrains
   - No specific Camry information

3. `20260221T073243Z__www-kbb-com__2025-toyota-camry.md`
   - Partial content: horsepower specs (225 FWD / 232 AWD), fuel economy (47-51 mpg), handling notes
   - Most useful of the three but still incomplete

**Recommendation:** These appear to be research on the 2025 Toyota Camry but were behind paywalls or had scraping issues. If vehicle research continues, consider manual capture or alternative sources. Can be deleted if no longer relevant.
