## Tasks

1. **Review Test Reports**
   - Read through all documents in `openclaw-vault/20 - Knowledge/make-openclaw-better/`

2. **Self-Analysis**
   - Research how I process requests internally
   - Understand my memory architecture and retrieval mechanisms
   - Identify bottlenecks in my workflow

3. **Deliverables**
