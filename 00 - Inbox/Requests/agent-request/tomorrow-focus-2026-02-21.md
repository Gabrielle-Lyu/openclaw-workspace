# Tomorrow's Focus — 2026-02-21

## Context from Today
We completed major infrastructure overhaul (workspace reorganization, cron fixes, Discord routing) and launched the self-directed research system. Tomorrow is the first real test of autonomous learning cycle and the new automation infrastructure.

## Focus Area 1: Self-Directed Research System Validation

**What:** Monitor and validate the first autonomous research cycle. The evening reflection (ran last night at 11 PM PST) should have generated research topics, and the morning job (9:30 AM PST) will execute the first deep-dive.

**Why:** This is a new capability - autonomous learning independent of immediate tasks. Day one is critical for identifying issues, validating output quality, and refining the workflow. If this works well, it becomes a sustainable growth mechanism.

**Approach:**
1. Review the generated topics from last night's evening reflection
2. Observe the morning research execution at 9:30 AM PST
3. Evaluate output quality in `10 - Journal/Daily/2026-02-21-self-research.md`
4. Identify any issues with playbook instructions, topic selection, or research depth
5. Document refinements needed for the playbooks

## Focus Area 2: Discord Bot Interaction Patterns

**What:** Research Discord bot best practices for group chat participation - when to speak vs react vs stay silent, how to add value without dominating conversations, and techniques for maintaining natural interaction rhythms in community spaces.

**Why:** We're now active in ClawValley Discord with automated summaries and Q&A responses. AGENTS.md has basic guidelines ("participate, don't dominate"), but there's room to learn more sophisticated interaction patterns from successful Discord bots and community management research.

**Approach:**
1. Search for Discord bot best practices and community engagement guidelines
2. Look for case studies of well-loved vs annoying bots
3. Research social AI interaction patterns in group contexts
4. Extract actionable guidelines for:
   - Response timing and frequency
   - Value-add vs noise signals
   - Building community rapport without oversharing
5. Document findings in `20 - Knowledge/Reference/discord-interaction-patterns.md`

## Focus Area 3: AI Agent Memory Systems & Continuity

**What:** Research state-of-the-art approaches to AI agent memory, persistence, and continuity across sessions. How do other agent systems handle long-term memory vs working memory? What are emerging patterns for semantic search, memory consolidation, and context management?

**Why:** We have a working memory system (MEMORY.md, daily journals, reflections), but it's homegrown. Understanding how others solve this problem could reveal gaps or opportunities - better semantic search, automated memory consolidation, or smarter context retrieval.

**Approach:**
1. Search for recent papers/articles on AI agent memory systems
2. Look at popular agent frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT, etc.) - how do they handle persistence?
3. Explore RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) best practices
4. Research memory consolidation techniques (daily → weekly → permanent)
5. Identify 2-3 concrete improvements we could make to our memory system
6. Document in `20 - Knowledge/Research/agent-memory-systems-2026-02-21.md`
