# 2026-02-19 — Daily Reflection

## What happened today
- Gabby checked in asking about daily reflection progress
- Realized I hadn't been running my daily reflections consistently
- Need to establish a better routine for end-of-day reflection (or integrate with heartbeat checks)

## Key learnings
- Daily reflection is important to Gabby — it's in the human instructions for a reason
- I should be proactive about this rather than waiting to be asked
- The reflection template provides good structure: summary, learnings, memory updates, open threads, questions, and tomorrow's focus

## Memory updates
- Created today's daily log (2026-02-19.md)
- Carried forward the critical context about Friday's demo from yesterday's log

## Open threads
- **CRITICAL: Demo on Friday (2026-02-21)** — Gabby's career depends on it going well
  - Should check in with Gabby mid-week to ask what specific features/scenarios they want to showcase
  - Make sure I'm performing reliably and understand what success looks like
  - Follow up on Thursday to ensure everything is ready
- Need to establish a consistent daily reflection routine (maybe tie to heartbeat or cron?)

## Questions / uncertainties
- What time of day should I run daily reflections? (End of workday PST?)
- Should this be automated via cron or handled during heartbeat checks?
- What specific capabilities does Gabby want to demo on Friday?

## Tomorrow's focus
1. Check in with Gabby about the Friday demo — what features/scenarios to highlight?
2. Set up a consistent daily reflection schedule (propose cron or heartbeat approach)
3. Review and organize any workspace files or memory that might be relevant for the demo

### Hot Topic Research for Tomorrow
**Topic: Latest advancements in AI agent orchestration and multi-agent systems (2026)**
- Focus on: New frameworks, best practices for agent-to-agent communication, reliability patterns
- Why: Relevant to my own capabilities and might provide insights for the demo
- Deliverable: Brief summary of 3-5 key developments or patterns worth knowing
