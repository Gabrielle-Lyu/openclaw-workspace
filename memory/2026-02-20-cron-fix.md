1. **8:00 AM** - Stock market intelligence summary
2. **8:10 AM** - AI industry briefing summary

[Fri 2026-02-20 07:26 UTC] For discord delivery, I only wants the combined hightlights. If I ask for actual doc, show me the actual report you generated
assistant: Got it! So you want:
- ✅ **8:30 AM combined summary** → Discord only
- ❌ **8:00 & 8:10 individual summaries** → No Discord (just save reports to files)
- When you ask for details → I show you the full saved report

Let me update those two jobs:
assistant: ## ✅ Discord Delivery Simplified!

Perfect! Now you'll **only get the combined highlights** at 8:30 AM on Discord. 🥂

---

## 📊 Updated Morning Workflow

**Silent (no Discord):**
- **8:00 AM** - Generate stock market report → Save to file
- **8:10 AM** - Generate AI briefing → Save to file

**Discord Delivery:**
- **8:30 AM** - Read both reports → Send combined highlights to Discord ✅

**Other Jobs:**
- **9:00 AM** - Process inbox docs (silent)
- **11:00 PM** - Daily reflection (silent)

---

## 📄 When You Want Full Reports

Just ask me:
- "Show me today's stock market report"
- "What's in the AI briefing?"

I'll read the full saved report from:
- `/home/ubuntu/openclaw-workspace/20 - Knowledge/Research/stock-market-insight/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `/home/ubuntu/openclaw-workspace/20 - Knowledge/Research/ai-daily-briefing/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

And share the complete analysis with you here.

[Fri 2026-02-20 07:28 UTC] Can I now safely delete openclaw-knowledge entire folder? No dependency?
assistant: Let me verify there are no remaining dependencies on the old folder:
assistant: ⚠️ **Not yet!** Found one critical reference in AGENTS.md that needs updating first.
assistant: ⚠️ **Wait!** Found 2 files still in the old dropzone. Let me check if they're duplicates:
assistant: ## ✅ Yes, Safe to Delete!

All content has been migrated successfully. Here's the verification:

**✅ Confirmed:**
- MEMORY.md is identical in both locations
- Reference docs all copied (new location has MORE - 10 vs 8 OCI docs)
- All cron jobs updated to new paths
- AGENTS.md updated to new paths
- No active system dependencies

**What's left in openclaw-knowledge:**
- 2 duplicate OCI docs in old dropzone (already in new structure)
- Old README files (structure templates)
- Duplicate reference docs (all in new location)
- 920KB total (all duplicates)

**Safe deletion command:**

```bash
rm -rf /home/ubuntu/openclaw-knowledge
```

Or if you want to be extra cautious, archive it first:

```bash
mv /home/ubuntu/openclaw-knowledge /home/ubuntu/openclaw-knowledge-BACKUP-2026-02-20
# Then delete after a few days if everything works fine
```

**The only references remaining are historical mentions in:**
- Memory logs (documenting the migration - harmless)
- Old workspace files (historical context - harmless)

Everything is now unified in `/home/ubuntu/openclaw-workspace/` with the clean numbered structure! 🥂

Want me to delete it, or do you want to do it yourself?

[Fri 2026-02-20 07:32 UTC] Now, since we have this new openclaw-workspace as your source of memory, embed it again and make sure the qmd/memroy_search works for this new folder
assistant: Good thinking! Let me check the current QMD configuration and re-embed the new workspace:

```

[Fri 2026-02-20 07:37 UTC] Did you finish the re-embed
assistant: Let me check the current status after those errors:
