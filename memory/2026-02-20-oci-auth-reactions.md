打开ackreactionscope
assistant: 我看到你想要配置 `ackReactionScope`（确认反应范围）。

**当前设置:**
```json
"ackReactionScope": "group-mentions"
```

**可用选项:**
- `"group-mentions"` — 只在群组中被提及时发送确认反应
- `"group-all"` — 群组中所有消息都发送确认反应
- `"direct"` — 只在私信中发送确认反应
- `"all"` — 所有消息都发送确认反应

你想要设置成哪一个？🥂

**English:**
I see you want to configure the `ackReactionScope` (acknowledgment reaction scope).

**Current setting:** `"group-mentions"` (only react when mentioned in groups)

**Available options:**
- `"group-mentions"` — React only when mentioned in groups
- `"group-all"` — React to all group messages
- `"direct"` — React only in direct messages
- `"all"` — React to all messages everywhere

Which one would you like? 🥂

擂椒皮蛋这个菜应该是热的还是冷的
assistant: **擂椒皮蛋应该是冷的（凉菜）。**

这是一道经典的湖南凉拌菜：

**特点:**
- 属于**凉菜/开胃菜**
- 通常在常温或冷藏后食用
- 夏天特别受欢迎，清凉爽口

**做法:**
- 皮蛋（切块）
- 青椒（烤/烧后捣成泥）
- 蒜、香菜、调味料
- 所有材料混合，冷藏后上桌

**为什么是冷的？**
- 皮蛋本身是凉食
- 擂椒（捣碎的辣椒）的香味在冷菜中更突出
- 作为开胃菜，冷食口感更好

Lei Jiao Pi Dan (Hunan-style mashed pepper with preserved egg) should be served **cold** — it's a classic cold appetizer dish! 🥂
