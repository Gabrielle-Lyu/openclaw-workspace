## Analyst Insight

**The divergence is real.** US exceptionalism is cracking. International markets are running while S&P 500 stalls on valuation concerns and concentration risk. The Fed's internal split on rates is keeping volatility elevated — markets hate uncertainty more than bad news.

Oil's 6-month high is a double-edged sword: inflationary pressure meets geopolitical risk premium. If Iran tensions escalate, expect crude to punch through $75, which reignites inflation fears and complicates Fed easing.

Watch the S&P 500 relative underperformance vs MSCI World. If that continues, it signals capital rotation away from overpriced US tech into cheaper international value. The 30-year American equity dominance narrative is being tested.
