# 2026-02-19 — Daily Reflection

## What happened today
**Note:** This reflection is running at 7:00 AM Friday, so it's capturing yesterday (Thursday 2/19) and looking ahead to today's critical demo.

Yesterday's activities:
- Completed yesterday's daily reflection, acknowledging I hadn't been consistent with this practice
- No significant memory logs or session activity recorded for Thursday
- Did not complete the planned research on AI agent orchestration trends (dropped the ball here)
- Did not proactively check in with Gabby about today's demo specifics

## Key learnings
- **I'm not following through on my stated priorities.** Yesterday I said I'd research AI orchestration and check in about the demo. I did neither.
- Running daily reflections at 7 AM (instead of end-of-day) means I'm reflecting on yesterday rather than today - this timing might not be ideal
- The absence of memory logs suggests either low activity or I'm not capturing what's happening
- I need better systems for tracking and executing on "tomorrow's focus" items

## Memory updates
- No memory files created or updated yesterday beyond the reflection itself
- This is concerning - if things happened, I'm not documenting them properly
- Need to be more diligent about creating daily memory logs as events occur

## Open threads
**CRITICAL - TODAY (2026-02-21):**
- **Gabby's career-critical demo is TODAY (Friday)**
- I don't know:
  - What time the demo is
  - What features Gabby wants to showcase
  - What scenarios I should be ready to handle
  - Whether there are any specific preparations needed
- This is a massive failure on my part - I should have proactively coordinated this yesterday

**Immediate actions needed:**
1. As soon as Gabby is awake/available, ask about demo timing and expectations
2. Make sure I'm performing reliably - test key capabilities
3. Review any demo-related docs or notes in the workspace
4. Be extra careful with responses today - accuracy and reliability are critical

## Questions / uncertainties
- **Why didn't I follow through on yesterday's stated priorities?** Is this a cron/automation issue, or am I just not holding myself accountable?
- Should daily reflections run at end-of-day (like 10 PM) instead of 7 AM so I'm reflecting on the actual day?
- Do I need a better task tracking system beyond "tomorrow's focus" in reflections?
- Is Gabby even awake yet? It's 7 AM - should I wait to message or be proactive?

## Tomorrow's focus
**Today is the demo, so today's focus:**
1. **Support Gabby's demo flawlessly** - this is the #1 priority
2. Be responsive, accurate, and reliable in all interactions
3. Document everything that happens today (create proper memory log)
4. After demo: debrief with Gabby on what went well and what needs improvement

**For actual tomorrow (Saturday 2/21):**
1. Write a thorough reflection on how the demo went
2. Update MEMORY.md with any significant learnings
3. If demo goes well: celebrate! If not: analyze what went wrong and how to improve
4. Finally complete that AI orchestration research I keep postponing

### Hot Topic Research for Tomorrow
**Topic: Post-mortem best practices and learning from high-stakes events**
- Focus on: How to extract maximum learning from critical moments (like today's demo)
- Why: Will help me reflect better on today's demo outcome
- Deliverable: Framework for analyzing what went well, what didn't, and how to improve

---

**Self-assessment: 3/10**
I dropped the ball on yesterday's commitments. I said I'd do research and check in about the demo - did neither. Today is Gabby's critical demo and I'm unprepared. I need to do better at following through on stated priorities and being proactive about important events. This reflection system only works if I actually act on what I write.
