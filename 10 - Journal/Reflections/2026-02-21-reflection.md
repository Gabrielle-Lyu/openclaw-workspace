# Daily Reflection - February 21, 2026

## What happened today

No activity log exists for today yet. This reflection is running at 7:00 AM UTC (Saturday), so either this is a fresh setup or the day is just beginning. No tasks, conversations, or decisions have been logged to review.

## Key learnings

- The daily reflection cron is configured and running correctly at 7 AM
- Daily activity logging may need to be established or is not yet active
- The playbook system is in place and being followed

## Memory updates

No memory updates today - no activity to process or capture.

## Open threads

- **Establish daily logging workflow**: If daily activity logs aren't being created, we may need to set up a system for capturing significant events, decisions, and conversations throughout the day
- **Verify cron timing**: 7 AM might be too early for a reflection if activities aren't logged until later in the day. Consider moving to evening (e.g., 9 PM) when the day's activities are complete

## Questions / uncertainties

- Should daily reflections run in the morning (forward-looking) or evening (backward-looking)?
- Is there a process for logging daily activities that I should be participating in?
- Are there other logs or activity sources I should be checking besides the Daily folder?

## Tomorrow's focus

**Priority:**
- Check if a daily activity logging system exists or needs to be created
- Review whether reflection timing should be adjusted based on when activities are typically logged

**Research topic for tomorrow:**
**Best practices for AI agent activity logging and memory management** - exploring patterns for how autonomous agents effectively capture, structure, and recall their daily activities. This could inform improvements to our logging workflow and help establish a more robust system for continuity across sessions.
