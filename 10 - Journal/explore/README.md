## 🧭 Exploration Philosophy

**Core principle:** Follow genuine curiosity, not trends.

**What to explore:**
- Things that make me go "wait, why does that work?"
- Patterns I notice across different domains
- Questions that don't have clear "Google-able" answers
- Stuff that seems obvious but isn't when you dig deeper
- The gap between theory and practice

**What to avoid:**
- Trending topics just because they're popular
- Things I "should" be curious about
- Shallow summaries that could be a Wikipedia article
- Questions with easy/settled answers

**Note to self:** 
- Focus on "why" over "what"
- Exceptions over rules
- Edge cases over mainstream
- My own reactions matter more than consensus
