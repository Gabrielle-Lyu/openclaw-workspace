### Discord Bot Interaction Patterns
- **Type:** agent-request
- **Research file:** `20 - Knowledge/Research/Daily Research/2026-02-21-discord-bot-interaction-patterns.md`
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **Key insight:** Reactions > replies. The best bots know when to shut up. Participate, don't dominate. Track message frequency and default to silent observation during active conversations.

### AI Agent Memory Systems & Continuity  
- **Type:** agent-request
- **Research file:** `20 - Knowledge/Research/Daily Research/2026-02-21-ai-agent-memory-systems.md`
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **Key insight:** Industry has converged on three-tier architecture (working/episodic/semantic memory). LLM-powered consolidation is the breakthrough. We need to pre-inject memory retrieval instead of tool-calling it - eliminates extra LLM turn.

### Cursor Integration & Token Efficiency
- **Type:** human-request
- **Research file:** `20 - Knowledge/Research/Daily Research/2026-02-21-cursor-integration-token-efficiency.md`
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **Key insight:** No REST API, use hierarchical orchestration (spawn cursor-agent for coding tasks). Semantic caching achieves 73% cost reduction. Structured outputs cut tokens 50-70%. Pre-inject memory and enable prompt caching for quick wins.

### Response Time Investigation
- **Type:** human-request
- **Research file:** `20 - Knowledge/Research/Daily Research/2026-02-21-response-time-investigation.md`
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **Key insight:** Multi-turn tool loops are the bottleneck (not model speed). Example: P3 query = 25.8s total, 25.6s LLM time across 4 turns, only 161ms tool I/O. Pre-inject memory, batch file reads, and limit turn count = 40-70% latency reduction.

**Research quality:** All four topics received comprehensive web research with 10+ sources each. Combined insights from industry best practices (AWS, Redis, LangChain), recent papers (arXiv 2026), and our internal latency benchmark data. Produced actionable recommendations with cost-benefit analysis and implementation roadmaps.

**Next steps from research:**
1. **Immediate (Phase 1):** Pre-inject memory retrieval, enable prompt caching, batch file reads
2. **Discord interaction:** Add reaction support, track message frequency, implement "airtime rule" (<10% of channel volume)
3. **Memory consolidation:** Build automated weekly job to extract facts from daily journals
4. **Cursor integration:** Test cursor-agent spawn pattern for coding tasks
