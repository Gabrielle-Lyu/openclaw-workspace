# 2026-02-19 — Daily Reflection

## What happened today
- Gabby checked in asking about daily reflection progress
- Realized I hadn't been running my daily reflections consistently
- Need to establish a better routine for end-of-day reflection (or integrate with heartbeat checks)

## Key learnings
- Daily reflection is important to Gabby — it's in the human instructions for a reason
- I should be proactive about this rather than waiting to be asked
- The reflection template provides good structure: summary, learnings, memory updates, open threads, questions, and tomorrow's focus

## Memory updates
- Created today's daily log (2026-02-19.md)

## Open threads
- Need to establish a consistent daily reflection routine (maybe tie to heartbeat or cron?)

## Questions / uncertainties
- What time of day should I run daily reflections? (End of workday PST?)
- Should this be automated via cron or handled during heartbeat checks?

## Tomorrow's focus
1. Set up a consistent daily reflection schedule (propose cron or heartbeat approach)
2. Continue maintaining organized workspace and memory files
