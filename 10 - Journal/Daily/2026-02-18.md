## OpenAI Codex Configuration

### Challenge: OAuth on Remote VM
Attempted to configure OpenAI Codex but hit browser opening issue on VM.

**Problem:**
- Running openclaw on remote VM
- OAuth flow trying to open browser on VM (no display)
- Codex on local machine

**Solution:**
- Manually copied OAuth URL to local browser
- Successfully configured `openai-codex:default` profile

**Final Setup:**
- Model: `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex`
- Auth: OAuth (ChatGPT login)
- Status: ✅ Configured and working

### Temporary Model Switch
- Temporarily disabled Claude to test Codex
- Removed `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` from allowed models
- Gateway restarted successfully

## OpenClaw Public Repo

**Task:** Clone public GitHub repo for reference

**Location:** `/home/ubuntu/openclaw-public`
- Remote: `https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw`
- Branch: `main`
- Latest commit: `6cbd00a3c`

**Context:**
Initially confused `.openclaw` (system config folder) with the public repo. Clarified and cloned public repo separately.

## Provider List Documentation

Documented all OpenClaw-supported providers (23 total):

**Major Cloud:**
- Anthropic (Claude)
- OpenAI (GPT)
- OpenAI Codex (OAuth)
- Google Gemini
- Google Vertex AI

**Alternative Cloud:**
- OpenCode Zen, xAI, Groq, Cerebras, Mistral

## Key Learnings

- OAuth flows on remote VMs require manual URL copying
- Multiple model providers can coexist (switched between Claude and Codex)
- System config folder (`.openclaw`) ≠ public repo

---

## Status at EOD

✅ Slack integration working
✅ OpenAI Codex configured successfully
✅ Public repo cloned for reference
✅ Model switching tested and working
