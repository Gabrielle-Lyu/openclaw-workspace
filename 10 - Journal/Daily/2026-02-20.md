# 2026-02-20 — Memory Log

**🚨 CRITICAL: Demo day for Gabby**

## Morning (7:00 AM)
- Completed daily reflection (saved to daily-reflections/2026-02-20-reflection.md)
- Acknowledged I didn't follow through on yesterday's priorities (research, demo check-in)
- Created this memory log to properly track today's events
- Waiting for Gabby to be available to discuss demo specifics

## Context carried forward
- Gabby's career depends on today's demo going well
- I need to be at my best: accurate, reliable, helpful
- Must document everything that happens today

_Events will be added throughout the day as they occur_
