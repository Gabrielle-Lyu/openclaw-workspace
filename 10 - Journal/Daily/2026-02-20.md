## Workspace Reorganization

Successfully reorganized `/home/ubuntu/openclaw-vault/` with numbered folder structure:

```
openclaw-vault/
├── 00 - Inbox/
│   ├── Requests/ (human-request + agent-request)
│   └── Docs/ (dropzone → processing → _done)
├── 10 - Journal/
│   ├── Daily/
│   └── Reflections/
├── 20 - Knowledge/
│   ├── Context/
│   ├── Decisions/
│   ├── Playbooks/
│   ├── Projects/
│   ├── Reference/
│   └── Research/
├── 30 - Automation/
│   └── Logs/
├── MEMORY.md
└── Workspace Constitution.md
```

## Cron Jobs Audit & Fix

Deleted 6 broken/duplicate cron jobs and recreated 5 with correct paths:

| Time | Job | Destination |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 8:00 AM PST | stock-market-insight-daily | `20 - Knowledge/Research/stock-market-insight/` + Discord |
| 8:10 AM PST | ai-daily-briefing | `20 - Knowledge/Research/ai-daily-briefing/` + Discord |
| 9:00 AM PST | daily-inbox-processing | `00 - Inbox/Docs/` |
| 11:00 PM PST | daily-reflection | `10 - Journal/Reflections/` |

## Interactions from Discord

### OCI Documentation Access
