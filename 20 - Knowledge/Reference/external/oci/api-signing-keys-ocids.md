You can use the Console to generate the private/public key pair for you.
If you already have a key pair, you can choose to upload the public key.
When you use the Console to add the key pair, the Console also generates
a configuration file preview snippet for you.

The following procedures work for a regular user or an administrator.
Administrators can manage API keys for either another user or
themselves.

**About the Config File Snippet**

When you use the Console to add the API signing key pair, a
configuration file preview snippet is generated with the following
information:

  - `user` - the OCID of the user for whom the key pair is being added.
  - `fingerprint` - the fingerprint of the key that was just added.
  - `tenancy` - your tenancy's OCID.
  - `region` - the currently selected region in the Console.
  - `key_file`- the path to your downloaded private key file. You must
    update this value to the path on your file system where you saved
    the private key file.

If your config file already has a DEFAULT profile, you'll need to do one
of the following:

  - Replace the existing profile and its contents.
  - Rename the existing profile.
  - Rename this profile to a different name after pasting it into the
    config file.

You can copy this snippet into your config file, to help you get
started. If you don't already have a config file, see [SDK and CLI
Configuration File](sdkconfig.htm) for details on how to create one. You
can also retrieve the config file snippet later for an API signing key
whenever you need it. See: To get the config file snippet for an API
signing key.

#### To generate an API signing key pair

**Prerequisite:** Before you generate a key pair, create the `.oci`
directory in your home directory to store the credentials. See [SDK and
CLI Configuration File](sdkconfig.htm) for more details.

1.  View the user's details:
    
      - If you're adding an API key for *yourself*:
        <div>
        In the **navigation
        menuÂ <span class="vl-1px-up" data-uk-icon="icon: info; ratio: .8"></span>**,
        select the **Profile** menu ![Profile menu
        icon](../../libraries/global-block-libraries/../../Resources/Images/usermenu.png)
        and then
        <span id="apisigningkey_topic_How_to_Generate_an_API_Signing_Key_Console__ph_select-option-you-see">select
        <span id="apisigningkey_topic_How_to_Generate_an_API_Signing_Key_Console__ph_options">**User
        settings**</span></span>.
        </div>
      - If you're an administrator adding an API key for *another user*:
        Open the **navigation
        menuÂ <span class="vl-1px-up" data-uk-icon="icon: info; ratio: .8"></span>**
        and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity**, select
        **Users**. Locate the user in the list, and then click the
        user's name to view the details.

2.  In the **Resources** section at the bottom left, click **API Keys**

3.  Click **Add API Key** at the top left of the **API Keys** list. The
    **Add API Key** dialog displays.

4.  Click **Download Private Key** and save the key to your `.oci`
    directory. In most cases, you do not need to download the public
    key.
    
    **Note**: If your browser downloads the private key to a different
    directory, be sure to move it to your `.oci` directory.

5.  Click **Add**.
    
    The key is added and the **Configuration File Preview** is
    displayed. The file snippet includes required parameters and values
    you'll need to create your configuration file. Copy and paste the
    configuration file snippet from the text box into your
    `~/.oci/config file`. (If you have not yet created this file, see
    [SDK and CLI Configuration File](sdkconfig.htm) for details on how
    to create one.)
    
    After you paste the file contents, you'll need to update the
    `key_file` parameter to the location where you saved your private
    key file.
    
    <div class="p">
    
    If your config file already has a DEFAULT profile, you'll need to do
    one of the following:
    
      - Replace the existing profile and its contents.
      - Rename the existing profile.
      - Rename this profile to a different name after pasting it into
        the config file.
    
    </div>

6.  Update the permissions on your downloaded private key file so that
    only you can view it:
    
    1.  Go to the `.oci` directory where you placed the private key
        file.
    2.  Use the command `chmod go-rwx ~/.oci/<oci_api_keyfile>.pem` to
        set the permissions on the file.

#### To upload or paste an API key

**Prerequisite:** You have generated a public **RSA key in PEM format
(minimum 2048 bits)**. The PEM format looks something like this:

<div class="uk-position-relative">

``` pre codeblock scrollcopy
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAoTFqF...
