# Security

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a Gen-2, security-first cloud. The
*security* pillar focuses on protecting users, safeguarding data, and
meeting regulatory and compliance requirements.

OCI lets you migrate your organization's mission-critical workloads to
the cloud while continuing to maintain or even improve your security
posture. Reduce the overhead of building and operating data center
infrastructure without sacrificing security.

The best practices in the *security* pillar help your organization to
define a secure cloud architecture, identify and implement the right
security controls, and monitor and prevent issues such as configuration
drift.

## Quick Links

Whether you're a security architect, a security administrator, or in
security operations, OCI provides detailed security documentation and
resources to support your role.

The following table helps you to quickly navigate to our most popular
security resources.

  - The **Services** column is a collection of OCI cloud-native security
    services and tools. These tools were designed and built as cloud
    services to help you achieve and maintain your target security
    posture. There's an assortment of tools to help you manage the
    security components at each layer of technology.
  - The **Best Practices Framework for OCI** column provides
    architectural guidance about how to build OCI services in a secure
    fashion, based on recommendations in the [Best practices framework
    for Oracle Cloud
    Infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oci-best-practices).
    Topics cover all security layers, and discuss recommended designs
    and configurations, including how best to apply OCI security
    tooling.
  - The **Security Guide** column includes links to documentation in the
    [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Security
    Guide](/iaas/Content/Security/Concepts/security_guide.htm). The
    Security Guide provides detailed instructions about how to deploy
    and implement security functionality across OCI resources. Review
    the security guide with your organization's architect and operations
    teams in the planning phase of your implementation.
