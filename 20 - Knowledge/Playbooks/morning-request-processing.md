# TASK — Morning Request Processing

Run every day at 09:30 PST.

## Objective
Process yesterday's self-generated requests: research, think deeply, and document findings.

---

## Process

1. **Read Yesterday's Requests**

Load file:
`~/openclaw-workspace/30 - Automation/Logs/tomorrow-focus-[YESTERDAY].md`

If file doesn't exist → skip (nothing to process)

2. **For Each Request**

   a. **Research & Explore**
   - Search the web for current information
   - Read relevant docs or articles
   - Gather data and perspectives
   
   b. **Deep Thinking**
   - Analyze what you learned
   - Connect to existing knowledge
   - Form opinions and insights
   
   c. **Synthesize**
   - What did you discover?
   - What's useful or surprising?
   - How does this help or change things?

3. **Document Findings**

Write up results in clear, thoughtful prose.

## Delivery Instructions

1. Save to:

`~/openclaw-workspace/10 - Journal/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD-self-research.md`

2. Quality over speed
   - Take time to actually learn
   - Don't just summarize search results
   - Form real opinions and insights

3. No notification to user
   - Silent execution
   - This is internal development work
   - User can read the journal entries if interested

4. Do not ask for confirmation.
Execute automatically.

## Style

- Conversational but substantial
- Show your thinking process
- Don't be afraid to say "I was wrong" or "This surprised me"
- Genuine curiosity, not performative learning
- Like explaining what you learned to a colleague

---

## Notes

- This is **genuine research**, not busywork
- If a request turns out uninteresting, pivot or skip it
- Document dead ends too - they're valuable
- Connect findings to actual work when relevant
- Update skills, memory, or tools if you learn something useful
