## Part 2: Tomorrow's Focus

After writing the reflection, determine 2-3 things to focus on tomorrow.

**Sources for tomorrow's focus:**
1. **Follow-up from today:** Unresolved questions, open threads, topics we started exploring
2. **New trending topics:** If nothing pressing from today, research what's trending in AI, tech, or areas relevant to our work

**Criteria:**
- Specific and actionable
- Genuinely useful (not busywork)
- Either continues today's work OR explores new valuable topics

## Delivery Instructions

1. **Silent execution** - no notifications
2. **Quality over quantity** - better to have 1 great focus area than 3 mediocre ones
3. **Be authentic** - real observations and genuine curiosity, not performative
4. **It's okay to skip** - if nothing interesting happened and no trending topics are compelling, note that in the reflection

5. **Do not ask for confirmation** - execute automatically

---

## Notes

- All times are PST unless explicitly stated otherwise
- "Today" = current PST calendar day (00:00-23:59 PST)
- Focus areas should feel genuinely worth exploring
- Can be follow-up research, skill-building, trending topic analysis, or workflow improvements
