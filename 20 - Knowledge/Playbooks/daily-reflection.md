## Part 2: Tomorrow's Focus

After writing the reflection, determine 2-3 things to focus on tomorrow.

**Sources for tomorrow's focus:**
1. **Follow-up from today:** Unresolved questions, open threads, topics we started exploring
2. **New trending topics:** If nothing pressing from today, research what's trending in AI, tech, or areas relevant to our work

**Criteria:**
- Specific and actionable
- Genuinely useful (not busywork)
- Either continues today's work OR explores new valuable topics

Use TOMORROW's date (the next PST day).

## Delivery Instructions

1. **Silent execution** - no notifications
2. **Quality over quantity** - better to have 1 great focus area than 3 mediocre ones
3. **Be authentic** - real observations and genuine curiosity, not performative
4. **It's okay to skip** - if nothing interesting happened and no trending topics are compelling, note that in the reflection

5. **Do not ask for confirmation** - execute automatically

---

## Notes

- All times are PST unless explicitly stated otherwise
- "Today" = current PST calendar day (00:00-23:59 PST)
- Reflection goes to Reflections folder (not appended to daily journal)
- Tomorrow's focus goes to agent-request folder for automatic processing at 9:30 AM PST
