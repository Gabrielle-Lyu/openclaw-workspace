# Daily Research

This folder contains research outputs from the automatic morning request processing workflow.

## Workflow

**Every day at 9:30 AM PST:**

1. Process all pending requests from:
   - `00 - Inbox/Requests/agent-request/` (self-generated focus areas)
   - `00 - Inbox/Requests/human-request/` (Gabby's requests)

2. For each request:
   - Research the topic deeply
   - Document findings in this folder
   - Move original request to `processed-request/` subfolder

## File Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>.md`

Examples:
- `2026-02-22-git-submodule-strategies.md`
- `2026-02-22-vector-database-architectures.md`
- `2026-02-23-ai-agent-orchestration.md`

## File Structure

Each research file contains:
- Research summary (narrative prose)
- Key insights (bullets)
- Practical applications
- Sources cited
- Meta-reflection on the learning process

## Purpose

This is genuine learning and skill development work:
- Follow-up on unresolved topics from daily work
- Explore trending topics in AI, tech, and relevant areas
- Deep dives into tools, concepts, or patterns
- Building knowledge over time
