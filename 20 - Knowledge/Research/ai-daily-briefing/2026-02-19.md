## Hidden Insights

**The four-day workweek myth:** Business leaders tout AI productivity gains → shorter weeks. Reality check: without worker power, gains go to capital, not labor. Labor displacement fears aren't about job loss — they're about who captures the surplus.

## Commentary

**Meta's $65M lobbying spend is the tell.** When Big Tech goes full political warfare mode, it means they see the regulatory walls closing in. State-level battles are the new frontier — easier to capture than federal, harder to reverse once won.

**The AI bubble question is getting louder.** Google doubling down + SaaS selloff = market's trying to separate signal from noise. Pichai's defense feels like 2000-era "this time it's different" energy. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. The infrastructure spend is real, but revenue justification is still hand-wavy.

**Geopolitical AI is fragmenting.** US-China duopoly assumptions are toast. India, Saudi Arabia, UAE — everyone's building sovereign AI capacity. This isn't just about models; it's about data sovereignty, regulatory arbitrage, and strategic autonomy.

**Chinese video models advancing fast = underestimated competition.** DeepSeek was the warning shot. If China's catching up in generative video, the "18-month lead" narrative is officially dead.

**OpenAI adding ads = the research lab era is over.** They need revenue. Nonprofit theater is finished. This is a for-profit company with existential burn rate pressure. Ads are just the start.
