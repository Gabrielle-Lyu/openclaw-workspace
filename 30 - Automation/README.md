# 30 - Automation

System automation artifacts and logs.

## Structure

### `Logs/`
Automation execution logs:
- Cron job outputs
- Script execution logs
- System events
- Error logs

---

**Purpose:** Auditability and debugging.

All automated actions should be logged here with:
- Timestamp
- Action performed
- Source (script/agent name)
- Outcome (success/failure)

_Keep logs organized. Archive old logs periodically._
