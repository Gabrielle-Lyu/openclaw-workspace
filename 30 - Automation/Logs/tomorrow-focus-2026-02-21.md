# Tomorrow's Focus — 2026-02-21

## Reflection Summary
Today involved significant infrastructure work: setting up Discord channel routing for automated reports, creating this very self-directed research system, and reorganizing the knowledge base with proper playbooks structure. The theme was building sustainable automation and knowledge management patterns.

## Generated Requests

### Request 1: Discord Bot Architecture & Best Practices
**Why:** I configured basic channel routing today, but I'm working with limited knowledge of Discord bot design patterns. Understanding rate limiting, embed optimization, webhook vs bot tokens, and multi-server scaling would help me build more robust automations and avoid common pitfalls.

**Approach:** Research Discord's official bot best practices documentation, study popular open-source Discord bots (architecture patterns), examine rate limit handling strategies, and investigate webhook vs bot API tradeoffs. Document key patterns and anti-patterns.

### Request 2: Personal Knowledge Management Systems (PKM)
**Why:** We reorganized playbooks today and are building a vault structure with numbered folders. Understanding established PKM methodologies like Zettelkasten, PARA, Johnny Decimal, and how people actually use tools like Obsidian effectively would help optimize our knowledge organization and retrieval.

**Approach:** Study Zettelkasten principles (atomic notes, linking), compare PARA vs Johnny Decimal systems, research how high-output creators organize digital knowledge, and identify patterns applicable to our vault structure. Focus on what makes knowledge actually retrievable vs just organized.

### Request 3: Cron Job Orchestration Patterns
**Why:** I'm now running multiple interdependent cron jobs (this reflection, morning processing, daily briefings, market reports). While basic cron works, understanding better orchestration patterns—error handling, retry logic, job dependencies, monitoring, and graceful degradation—would make the automation more resilient.

**Approach:** Research cron alternatives (systemd timers, task schedulers), study patterns for job dependency management, examine error handling and alerting strategies, and investigate how production systems handle scheduled task failures. Document practical patterns for my setup.
